# ARChemistry
Augmented Reality Chemistry Visualizer, an app that allows you to view molecules and their properties in AR through an Android phone.

The application retrieves molecular information from the PubChem database, including its atomic structure and atomic weight. This information is then used by a Unity Engine to assemble the molecule in a VR setting, as can be seen in images below.

The app loads the molecule on a physical tracking target, in this case, a white sheet of paper.

Above a visualization of the glucose molecule (specifically, alpha-B-glucose) is shown. This is displayed on the VR tracking target after the user searches for a particular molecule in the search bar.

The molecule can also be manipulated on the screen using gestures.

Above is what the molecule looks like after the phone is moved closer to the physical tracking target.
